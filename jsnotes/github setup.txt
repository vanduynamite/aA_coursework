Create the repo folder on the computer with files in it

Go to github and create a new folder with the same name

In the New Respository screen, it'll give you a url to use, but that just follows:

https://github.com/vanduynamite/new-repo-name.git

Back on the computer, navigate to the repo directory

type:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "comment"
git remote add origin <the url above>
git remote -v //this one is just to make sure you didn't get that url incorrectly
git push -u origin master

That's it I believe!
